# Video Application Frontend

## This repository serves as the frontend for the Video Application I'm working on. The application is a simplified version of YouTube, with a Login screen where users can Sign-In and Sign-Up using their credentials. The home screen displays all of the videos from the channels to which the user has subscribed, followed by the Video screen, which allows the user to watch an individual video with a recommended video section and a separate comment section.
